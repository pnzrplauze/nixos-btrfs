*** TODO Share config in ~/jack/.config with root (for editing /etc/nixos in emacs).
** Neovim
For quick editing.
*** TODO Share config in ~/jack/.config with root.
*** TODO Call neovim's config declaratively in /etc/nixos.

* Browser

*** TODO Call firefox's configuration in /etc/nixos (automatic ad-block install and so on).
